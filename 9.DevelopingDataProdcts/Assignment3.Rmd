##Introduction
This slidedeck will showcase a plot using the "mtcars" dataset and will use the `plot_ly` library

##The code
Below is the code that will be used to create the plot (please refer for next slide for the plot)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Load 'plot_ly' library
suppressPackageStartupMessages(require(plotly))

#Load 'mtcars' dataset
data("mtcars")

#create the plot
plot_ly(mtcars, x=~wt, y=~mpg, type="scatter")
```

##The plot
Below is the result of the code from the previous slide:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Load 'plot_ly' library
suppressPackageStartupMessages(require(plotly))

#Load 'mtcars' dataset
data("mtcars")

#create the plot
plot_ly(mtcars, x=~wt, y=~mpg, type="scatter")
```
